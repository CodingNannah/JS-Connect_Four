This is a simple Player vs. Player "Connect Four" game, which I adapted from Kenny Yip's Tutorial.

Game Creation Notes:
I was enlightened as Kenny explained the concept of what sections we needed to check and how to loop over the sections to check for a winner.

I did a bit of research and implemented how to change the color and the background color of the winner message in JS, rather than CSS.
